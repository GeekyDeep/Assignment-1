Q5. Write a program to find the circumference of a circle with radius 10 in C++.
Ans:
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int radius;
    cout<<"Enter the radius of the circle:";
    cin>>radius;
    cout<<"The circumference of the circle is:"<<2*3.1415*radius;
    
}

Q6. How many of these can be a variable name ?

01Pwskills
_FLOAT
int
FLOAT
You will succeed

Ans:

Only _FLOAT and FLOAT are correct and can be a variable name because variable names can have _ so that's why _FLOAT is correct and FLOAT is also correct as C++ is case sensitive so it's not the same as float data type.
